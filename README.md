# KeyLogger
Not your typical KeyLogger, an advanced key logger that can save every key pressed on your computer from the alphabet and numbers to the F1->F12, Home, Page Up, Page Down Keys, and the ability to distinguish if keys are in uppercase (Caps Lock On Or Shift On) and distinguish if you're pressing the symbols (!@#$%^&*()_+-=). Some features:

* Save the file to the temporary files/log.tmp

* Creates a copy in the StartUp files.

* Adds its self to the registry to make sure it runs.

* Creates a mutex so that it can only run Once!!

* The best of the best is kept for last, it loads a function from the ntdll.dll to set this process to being CRITICAL, which means you can't kill it, and this function isn't detectable by many Anti-Virus software.

Use it under your own RISK!
